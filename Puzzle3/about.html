        <h2 class = desc>About Page</h2>
		
        <p class = para1>
		This store and its products were all made by a newbie programmer. We had asked the programmer to write a little blurb about themselves, however they ended up filling an entire page due to their narcissism.</br>
		So instead, we asked the programmer to limit their blurb to 30 words. This is what they've sent:</br></br>
		<i>"Hah! You think some foolish word counter will stop me? I'm a programmer! I know ways to make secret comments without any of you the wiser! Muhahahaha! Buy my products."</i>
        </p>
		<! -- Yesss you found my secret comments! See, I told you people wanted to pay attention to me! -->
		<! -- I'm actually going to publish an autobiography, but here's a freebie for you: I LOVE RPG Maker! -->
		<! -- Fun fact, if an RPG Maker game is hosted on a website (like as an html5 file), did you know you can access the console and totally mess with it? -->
		<! -- My favourite is entering: "$gamePlayer.setThrough(true)", cause that makes your character able to walk through walls, hehe. -->
		<! -- Oops I got distracted about the most important topic: myself! -->
		<! -- Ehh, if you want to learn more, you should read my autobiography. I haven't written it yet but I'm sure it'll be great :p -->

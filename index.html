        <h2 class = desc>Description:</h2>
        <p class = para1>For our unessay we have created a series of interactive puzzles that incorporate a range of security concepts designed to challenge the knowledge of the users on these topics. The goal of these puzzles is to let the users test their knowledge of these concepts in a safe and secure way. For each puzzle there is a code in each one at the end, when it is found it is to be input into the text box below the puzzle. If the code is correct the box will turn red, your goal is to get all three codes. The concepts here mainly revolve around web safety and security but there are elements of concepts like hashing, password security, sql injections and many more. By completing these puzzles, users will be able to better understand these concepts.

            For your first task we need you to retrieve an email hidden in this company's database. Before you actually do that we have simulated the SQL database on the next page for you to practice this. Remember that the email is hidden in the database and all we know is that the email is associated with the identification number of 1000. Once you retrieve the email, put it into the text box to validate that it is correct. For this puzzle you are not allowed to use the developer console. Click the box above that says Puzzle 1 to begin, good luck.
